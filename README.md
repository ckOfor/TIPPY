# IP Rights Management Smart Contract

A decentralized platform for tokenizing and managing intellectual property (IP) rights on the Stacks blockchain. This system enables creators to tokenize their IP assets, sell fractional ownership, and manage rights through automated smart contracts.

## Features

- **IP Token Management**
    - Mint NFTs representing IP rights
    - Transfer ownership
    - Track metadata and provenance

- **Royalty System**
    - Automated royalty distribution
    - Configurable royalty percentages
    - Real-time payment processing

- **Governance**
    - Proposal creation and voting
    - Democratic decision-making for IP usage
    - Time-locked voting periods

- **Marketplace**
    - List IP tokens for sale
    - Purchase with automatic royalty distribution
    - Active listing management

```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ip-rights-management.git
cd ip-rights-management
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Setup Clarinet environment:
```bash
clarinet integrate
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
npm test
```

Run with coverage:
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

## Contract Deployment

1. Configure your network in `Clarinet.toml`

2. Deploy contracts:
```bash
clarinet deploy
```

## Usage Examples

### Minting an IP Token

```clarity
(contract-call? .ip-token mint 
    "https://example.com/ip/1" 
    "Patent XYZ" 
    "Revolutionary technology patent" 
    u10)
```

### Creating a Listing

```clarity
(contract-call? .ip-token create-listing u1 u1000)
```

### Voting on a Proposal

```clarity
(contract-call? .ip-token vote u1 true)
```

## Security Considerations

- Ownership validation on all transfers
- Royalty percentage limits
- Time-locked voting periods
- Access control for administrative functions
